This article examines the findings of studies on non-human primate laboratory animals where different technologies are applied. Further, the authors describe how the information generated by those technologies was used for developing non-invasive behavioral assessment techniques.\\n\\nHere are the benefits of the approach:\\n• The animals are under non-stressful experimental conditions\\n• It offers non-invasive ways of measuring animal behaviors:\\n\\n• The animals can be observed facing a mesh panel, without the direct restraint. Any test depends on the cooperation of the animal and its ability to rationally behave. In fact,', role=<Role.ASSISTANT: 'assistant'>))] object='chat.completion'\n"

This article examines the findings of studies on non-human primate laboratory animals where different technologies are applied. Further, the authors describe how the information generated by those technologies was used for developing non-invasive behavioral assessment techniques.\n",
